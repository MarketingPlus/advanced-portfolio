## Repository üìÅ

What I have been doing to keep my repo clean and up to date

- I have constantly used git add, commit and push to ensure all changes have been updated to the github repo
- added extensive comments describing changes and what they could possibly mean for the client or developer
- Created a high quality read me file using different methods to convey and display info

## Code üñ•Ô∏è

- I have ensure my code has remained clean and concise by implementing the following:
  - comments throughout my HTML and CSS to ensure I will understand what every line of code is used for or what element it affects
  - my indetntation allows me to find the start of every element and end
  - made sure all of my class name have followed the best naming conventions

> EXAMPLE: this code shows the my indentation, comments, and class nameing conventions used for this project:

```HTML
<!-- NAVIGATION TOP -->
    <nav id="navbar" class="navbar">
        <div class="buttons">
            <ul class="top__buttons">
                <li><div class="red__button"></div></li>
                <li><div class="yellow__button"></div></li>
                <li><div class="green__button"></div></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </nav>
```

> **(PLEASE NOTE THAT CODE WILL DIFFER IN ACTUAL HTML AS I HAVE FORMATED IT TO SUIT THIS DOCUMENT BETTER)**

> EXAMPLE: this code shows the equivent to the code above but for CSS:

```CSS
/* I have seprate headers for desktop and mobile */

.navbar__mobile {
  display: none;
}

/* To show its an interactable tab that can be moved */

.navbar:hover {
  cursor: grab;
}

/* button positioning and styling */

ul .top__buttons {
  margin-right: 0px;
  display: flex;
}
```
